# With a monorepo, it can be hard to know who should review your change. This file defines responsible
# individuals for various packages and files to aid finding reviewers or those with appropriate context.
#
# Updating this file:
# There is no formal policy to update this file. If you feel like you want to "stay updated" on changes to specific
# folders, packages, or glob patterns, make a PR and get a review from someone on the team to add yourself.
#
# NOTE: the file format uses "later match takes precedence" structure so be mindful that glob patterns and other paths you
# add later in the file don't accidentally remove ownership.

# File syntax:

# Any file(s) or path(s) not assigned to someone specific falls back to these owners
