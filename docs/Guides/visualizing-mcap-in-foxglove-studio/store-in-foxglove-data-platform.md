## Benefits

Instead of having to pass around hard drives every time you want to share data, you can start importing your MCAP data into a central repository for all your teammates to access and collaborate on.

Instead of having to download enormous files to your local machine whenever you want to inspect some data, you can stream your team data directly to [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/studio) for further analysis.
