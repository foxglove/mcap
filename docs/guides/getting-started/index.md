# Introduction

You may be interested in using MCAP for a variety of scenarios throughout your robotics development workflows.

If you're starting from scratch, you may want to write code to **read and write your own MCAP data**.

If you already have existing data that is not in the MCAP file format, you may want to **convert this non-MCAP data into MCAP files**.

Once you have MCAP data to work with, you may want to **inspect, visualize, and store your MCAP files**.
