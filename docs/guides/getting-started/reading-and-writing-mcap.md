# Reading and Writing MCAP

If you're starting from scratch, you may want to write code to **read and write your own MCAP data**.

We provide MCAP readers and writers in the following languages:

- [Python](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/python)
- [C++](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/cpp)
- [Go](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/go)
- [Swift](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/swift)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/typescript)

To start using MCAP with any of the supported [data serialization formats](../../specification/appendix.md), check out the [Python](../python/writing-jsonschema.md) and [C++](../cpp/writing-protobuf.md) tutorials in our **Guides** section.
