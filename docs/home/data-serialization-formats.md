# Data Serialization Formats

MCAP files can store multiple streams of heterogeneous data, serialized in any of the following data formats:

- [ROS 1](http://wiki.ros.org/)
- [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/)
- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
- [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
- [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/)

To start reading and writing MCAP messages in these formats, check out the [Python](../guides/python/ros1.md) and [C++](../guides/cpp/protobuf.md) tutorials in our [Guides](../getting-started/overview.md) section.
