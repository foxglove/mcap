## Overview

MCAP is a container file format for append-only storage of heterogeneously-schematized data. It is inspired by the ROS1 bag format and is intended to support flexible serialization options, while also generalizing to non-ROS systems and retaining characteristics such as self-containment and chunk compression. Features include:

- Single-pass, indexed writes (no backward seeking)
- Flexible message serialization options (e.g. ros1, protobuf, â€¦)
- Self-contained (message schemas are included in the file)
- Fast remote file summarization
- File attachments
- Optional chunk compression
- Optional CRC integrity checks

### Glossary

Some helpful terms to understand in the following sections are:

- **Record**: A [TLV triplet][tlv wiki] with type and value corresponding to one of the opcodes and schemas below.
- **Topic**: A named message type and associated schema.
- **Channel**: A logical stream that contains messages on a single topic. Channels are associated with a numeric ID by the recorder - the **Channel ID**.
- **Channel Info**: A type of record describing information about a channel, notably containing the name and schema of the topic.
- **Message**: A type of record representing a timestamped message on a channel (and therefore associated with a topic/schema). A message can be parsed by a reader that has also read the channel info for the channel on which the message appears.
- **Chunk**: A record type that wraps a compressed set of channel info and message records.
- **Attachment**: Extra data that may be included in the file, outside the chunks. Attachments may be quickly listed and accessed via an index at the end of the file.
- **Index**: The format contains indexes for both messages and attachments. For messages, there are two levels of indexing - a **Chunk Index** at the end of the file points to chunks by offset, enabling fast location of chunks based on channel and timerange. A second index - the **Message Index** - after each chunk contains, for each channel in the chunk, and offset and timestamp for every message to allow fast location of messages within the uncompressed chunk data. The attachment index at the end of the file allows for fast listing and location of attachments based on name, timestamp, or attachment type.
- **Statistics**: A type of record at the end of the file, used to support fast summarization of file contents.
- **Message Data Section**: Used in this doc to refer to the first portion of the file that contains chunks and message data. To be distinguished from the **Index Data Section**.
- **Index Data Section**: The last part of the file, containing records used for searching and summarizing the file. The Index Data section is split into a **channel info portion**, **chunk index portion**, and **attachment index portion** each containing contiguous runs of the corresponding record type, followed by a **Statistics** record. All portions of the index data section are optional, subject to constraints and tradeoffs described below. There are no other record types in the index data section.

## Format Description

An MCAP file is physically structured as a series of concatenated **"records"**, each prefixed with a uint8 type and uint64 length, capped on each end with magic bytes:

    <MAGIC>[<record type><record len><record>...]<MAGIC>

These are the magic bytes:

    0x89, M, C, A, P, 0x30, \r, \n

> Note: The version byte (ASCII zero 0x30) following "MCAP" will be updated to 1 (0x31) upon ratification of this specification. Until then, backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

The first record in every file must be a Header (op=0x01) and the last record must be a Footer (op=0x02).

MCAP files may contain a variety of record types. Specific constraints on valid usage of the record types is explained in the sections below, but in general record types may be used or not depending on the feature requirements of the consumer.

The diagrams below show two possible variants - a file that is chunked and indexed, i.e making full use of the features, and one that is unchunked but contains statistics.

### Record Types

Record types are identified by single-byte **opcodes**. Record opcodes in the range 0x01-0x7F are reserved for future MCAP format usage. 0x80-0xFF are reserved for application extensions and user proposals.

##### Serialization and Notation

The section below uses the following data types and serialization choices. In all cases integers are serialized little endian:

- **Timestamp**: uint64 nanoseconds since a user-understood epoch (i.e unix epoch, robot boot time, etc)
- **String**: a uint32-prefixed UTF8 string
- **KeyValues<T1, T2>**: A uint32 length-prefixed association of key-value pairs

```
<length><T1 (key)><T2 (value)><T1 (key)><T2 (value)>
```

- **Array<T>**: A uint32 length-prefixed array.

```
<length><T><T><T>
```

An empty Array consists of a zero-value length prefix.

- **Bytes**: refers to an array of bytes, without a length prefix. If a length prefix is required a designation like "uint32 length-prefixed bytes" will be used.

#### Header (op=0x01)

The first record in every MCAP file is a header.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 + N | profile | String | The profile to use for interpretation of channel info user data. If the value matches one of the [supported profiles][profiles], the channel info user data section should be structured to match the description in the corresponding profile. This field may also be supplied empty, or containing a framework that is not one of those recognized. |
| N | library | String | freeform string for writer to specify its name, version, or other information for use in debugging |
| N | metadata | KeyValues<string, string> | Example keys: robot_id, git_sha, timezone, run_id. |

#### Footer (op=0x02)

The last record in every MCAP file is a footer.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | index_offset | uint64 | Pointer to start of index section. If there are no records in the index section, this should be zero. |
| 4 | index_crc | uint32 | CRC32 checksum of all data from index_offset through the byte immediately preceding this CRC. A value of zero indicates that CRC validation should not be performed. |

A file without a footer is **corrupt**, indicating the writer process encountered an unclean shutdown. It may be possible to recover data from a corrupt file.

#### Channel Info (op=0x03)

Identifies a stream of messages on a particular topic and includes information about how the messages should be decoded by readers. A channel info record must occur in the file prior to any message that references its Channel ID. Channel IDs must uniquely identify a channel across the entire file. If message indexing is in use, the Channel Info section of the index data section must also be in use.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | id | uint16 | Channel ID 1 | 1 |
| 4 + N | topic_name | String | Topic | /diagnostics |
| 4 + N | encoding | String | Message Encoding | cdr, cbor, ros1, protobuf, etc. |
| 4 + N | schema_name | String | Schema Name | std_msgs/Header |
| 4 + N | schema | uint32 length-prefixed bytes | Schema |  |
| N | user_data | KeyValues<string, string> | Metadata about this channel | used to encode protocol-specific details like callerid, latching, QoS profiles... Refer to [supported profiles][profiles]. |

#### Message (op=0x04)

A message record encodes a single timestamped message on a particular channel. In a given file, messages must appear either inside Chunks, or outside Chunks. A file may not contain both chunked and unchunked messages.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | channel_id | uint16 | Channel ID |
| 4 | sequence | uint32 | Optional message counter assigned by publisher. If not assigned by publisher, must be recorded by the recorder. |
| 8 | publish_time | Timestamp | Time at which the message was published. If not available, must be set to the record time. |
| 8 | record_time | Timestamp | Time at which the message was recorded by the recorder process. |
| N | message_data | Bytes | Message data, to be decoded according to the schema of the channel. |

#### Chunk (op=0x05)

A Chunk is a collection of compressed channel info and message records. If message indexing is in use, Chunks are required.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | uncompressed_size | uint64 | Uncompressed size of of the "records" section. |
| 4 | uncompressed_crc | uint32 | CRC32 checksum of uncompressed "records" section. A value of zero indicates that CRC validation should not be performed. |
| 4 + N | compression | String | compression algorithm | lz4, zstd, "". A zero-length string indicates no compression. Refer to [supported compression formats][compression formats]. |
| N | records | Bytes | Concatenated records, compressed with the algorithm in the "compression" field. |

#### Message Index (op=0x06)

The Message Index record maps timestamps to message offsets. If message indexing is in use, following each chunk, a message index record is written for each channel in the chunk preceding. All message index records for a chunk must immediately follow the chunk in a contiguous run of records.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | channel_id | uint16 | Channel ID. |
| N | records | Array<{ Timestamp, uint64 }> | Array of record_time and offset for each record. Offset is relative to the start of the uncompressed chunk data. |

#### Chunk Index (op=0x07)

The Chunk Index records form a coarse index of timestamps to chunk offsets, along with the locations of the message index records associated with those chunks. They are found in the chunk index portion of the index data section. If message indexing is in use, Chunk Indexes are required. A Chunk Index record must be preceded in the index data section by Channel Info records for any channels that it references.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | start_time | Timestamp | First message record timestamp in the chunk. |
| 8 | end_time | Timestamp | Last message record timestamp in the chunk. |
| 8 | offset | uint64 | Offset to the chunk record from the start of the file. |
| N | message_index_offsets | KeyValues<uint16, uint64> | Mapping from channel ID to the offset of the message index record for that channel after the chunk, from the start of the file. Duplicate keys are not allowed. |
| 8 | message_index_length | uint64 | Total length in bytes of the message index records after the chunk, including lengths and opcodes. |
| 4 + N | compression | String | The compression used on this chunk. Refer to [supported compression formats][compression formats]. |
| 8 | compressed_size | uint64 | The compressed size of the chunk. |
| 8 | uncompressed_size | uint64 | The uncompressed size of the chunk. |

#### Attachment (op=0x08)

Attachments can be used to attach artifacts such as calibration data, text, or core dumps. Attachment records must not appear within a chunk.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 + N | name | String | Name of the attachment, e.g "scene1.jpg". |
| 8 | record_time | Timestamp | Time at which the attachment was recorded. |
| 4 + N | content_type | String | MIME Type (e.g "text/plain"). |
| 8 + N | data | uint64 length-prefixed bytes | Attachment data. |
| 4 | crc | uint32 | CRC32 checksum of preceding fields in the record. A value of zero indicates that CRC validation should not be performed. |

#### Attachment Index (op=0x09)

The attachment index is an index to named attachments within the file. One record is recorded per attachment in the file. The attachment index records are written to the attachment index portion of the message data section.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | record_time | Timestamp | Timestamp at which the attachment was recorded. |
| 8 | data_size | uint64 | Size of the attachment data. |
| 4 + N | name | String | Name of the attachment. |
| 4 + N | content_type | String | MIME type of the attachment. |
| 8 | offset | uint64 | Byte offset to the attachment, from the start of the file. |

#### Statistics (op=0x0A)

The statistics record contains statistics about the recorded data. It is the last record in the file before the footer. The record must be preceded in the index data section by Channel Info records for any channels referenced in the `channel_message_counts` field. If this is undesirable but some statistics are still desired, the field may be set to a zero-length map. The statistics record is optional.

| Bytes | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | message_count | uint64 | Number of messages in the file across all topics. |
| 4 | channel_count | uint32 | Number of channels in the file across all topics. |
| 4 | attachment_count | uint32 | Number of attachments in the file. |
| 4 | chunk_count | uint32 | Number of chunks in the file. |
| N | channel_message_counts | KeyValues<uint16, uint64> | Mapping from channel ID to total message count for the channel. Duplicate keys are not allowed. |
