# Library Features and Support Matrix

## Library Support

The Python, C++, Go, and Typescript MCAP libraries are actively developed. This means that Foxglove actively pursues bug fixes and ensures conformance with the MCAP specification.

**Note**: This does not mean that their APIs are stable.

The Swift MCAP library is experimental, and not actively developed. This means that PRs contributing bug-fixes are welcome, but GitHub Issues regarding it will not be prioritized.

## Feature Matrix

|  | Python | C++ | Go | Typescript | Swift |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Indexed unordered message reading | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Timestamp-ordered message reading | No | Partial [^2] | Partial [^3] | Yes | No |
| Indexed metadata reading | Yes | Yes [^1] | Yes [^1] | Yes [^1] | No |
| Indexed attachment reading | Yes | Yes [^1] | Yes [^1] | Yes [^1] | No |
| Non-materialized attachment reading | No | Yes [^5] | No | No | No |
| Non-Indexed reading | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| CRC Validation | No | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| ROS1 wrapper | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| ROS2 wrapper | Yes [^4] | Yes [^4] | No | No | No |
| Protobuf wrapper | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| Record Writing | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Easy chunked Writing | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes [^6] | Yes [^6] |
| Automatic summary writing | Yes [^7] | Yes [^7] | Yes [^7] | Yes [^7] | Yes [^7] |

[^1]: These readers donâ€™t have a single call to read an attachment or metadata record by name, but do allow you to read the summary, seek to that location, read a record and parse it.
[^2]: C++ reader does not assume chunk indices are in order but assumes all messages in a chunk are in order and chunk time ranges do not overlap.
[^3]: Go reader does not assume messages or chunks are in order but assumes chunks do not overlap in time.
[^4]: Uses the [MCAP Rosbag2 storage plugin](https://github.com/ros-tooling/rosbag2_storage_mcap), only works within a ROS workspace.
[^5]: The C++ reader interface does not preclude one from implementing it with a memory-mapped file. This could be used to implement message and attachment parsing without copying data into memory.
[^6]: Swift /Typescript can write in chunks, but asks the user to bring their own compression library and set the compression method string themselves.
[^7]: All writers currently do not compute a CRC for the DataEnd record.
