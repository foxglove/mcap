# Library Features and Support Matrix

## Library Support

The Python, C++, Go, and TypeScript MCAP libraries are actively developed. This means that Foxglove actively pursues bug fixes and ensures conformance with the MCAP specification.

**Note**: This does not mean that their APIs are stable.

[^1]: These readers donâ€™t have a single call to read an attachment or metadata record by name, but do allow you to read the summary, seek to that location, read a record and parse it.
[^2]: Using the [MCAP Rosbag2 storage plugin](https://github.com/ros-tooling/rosbag2_storage_mcap).
[^3]: The C++ reader interface does not preclude one from backing it with a memory-mapped file. This could be used to implement message and attachment parsing without copying data into memory.
[^4]: All writers currently do not compute a CRC for the DataEnd record.
