# @mcap/core

[MCAP](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap) is a modular container format and logging library for pub/sub messages with arbitrary message serialization. It is primarily intended for use in robotics applications, and works well under various workloads, resource constraints, and durability requirements.

The `@mcap/core` package provides low-level readers and writers for the MCAP format in TypeScript.

## Examples

Examples of how to use the `@mcap/core` APIs can be found in the [TypeScript examples folder](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/typescript/examples) in the MCAP repo.
