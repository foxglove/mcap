# Concepts

MCAP organizes its data via messages, channels, and schemas.

## Message

The unit of communication between nodes in the pub/sub system.

## Channel

A stream of messages which have the same type, or schema. Often corresponds to a connection between a publisher and a subscriber.

## Schema

A description of the structure and contents of messages on a channel, e.g. a [Protobuf Schema](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/) or [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
