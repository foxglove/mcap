# Writing JSON

## Writing

Let's work with some publicly available data – the "[Sydney Urban Objects Dataset](https://www.acfr.usyd.edu.au/papers/SydneyUrbanObjectsDataset.shtml)", released by the [Australian Centre for Field Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html) – and write it as JSON to an MCAP file. ![sydney](./json-sydney.png)

This CSV dataset contains a variety of common urban road objects scanned with a Velodyne HDL-64E LIDAR. Each of the 600+ scanned object contains the following fields:

- `t` - Timestamp
- `intensity` - Laser return intensity
- `id` - Laser ID
- `x,y,z` - 3D point coordinates
- `azimuth` - Horizontal azimuth angle
- `range` - Range of laser return
- `pid` - Point ID of the original scan

### Decode CSV data

Use Python's built-in [`csv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) and [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) libraries to decode this CSV data:

```python
def point_reader(csv_path: typing.Union[str, Path]):
  with open(csv_path, "r") as f:
    for timestring, i, _, x, y, z, _, _, _ in csv.reader(f):
      timestamp = datetime.datetime.strptime(timestring, "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S.%f")
      yield (timestamp, float(i), float(x), float(y), float(z))
```

This prints out the timestamp, intensity, and coordinates for each point in the CSV file you choose to read in.

### Encode data as a `foxglove.PointCloud`

Let's encode this CSV data as a [`foxglove.PointCloud` schema](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/messages/point-cloud), so we can later visualize this data in [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/studio):

| field          | type                 | description                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp`    | time                 | Timestamp of point cloud                                         |
| `frame_id`     | string               | Frame of reference                                               |
| `pose`         | Pose                 | The origin of the point cloud relative to the frame of reference |
| `point_stride` | uint32               | Number of bytes between points in the data                       |
| `fields`       | PackedElementField[] | Fields in the data                                               |
| `data`         | bytes                | Point data, interpreted using fields                             |

The `foxglove.PointCloud` schema expects a `data` field that contains a single base64-encoded buffer with all point data, as well as a `fields` field that contains metadata describing how to decode the `data`.

Since `foxglove.PointCloud` requires a single timestamp, let's get it from the first point we see in our file. Then, we'll pack each field as a four byte single-precision little-endian float.

Let's start by describing the layout of our data in a `foxglove.PointCloud` message:

```python
float32 = 7  # as defined in the schema
pointcloud = {
  "point_stride": (4 + 4 + 4 + 4),  # four bytes per float
  "fields": [
    {"name": "x", "offset": 0, "type": float32},
    {"name": "y", "offset": 4, "type": float32},
    {"name": "z", "offset": 8, "type": float32},
    {"name": "i", "offset": 12, "type": float32},
  ],
}
```

Next, let's pack the points using Python's built-in [`struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) and [`base64`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html) libraries.

```python
points = bytearray()
base_timestamp = None
for point_timestamp, intensity, x, y, z in point_reader(args.csv):
  if base_timestamp is None:
    base_timestamp = point_timestamp
  points.extend(struct.pack("<ffff", x, y, z, intensity))
assert base_timestamp is not None, "found no points in input csv"
pointcloud["data"] = base64.b64encode(points).decode("utf-8")
```

Each 3D object must exist in its own coordinate frame. A point cloud's `frame_id` identifies the coordinate frame it belongs in, and its `pose` determines its relative position from that coordinate frame's center. Since we will only have one coordinate frame in our MCAP file, we can choose any arbitrary string as our `frame_id`, and use the identity pose to place our point cloud in its center.

```python
pointcloud["pose"] = {
  "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
  "orientation": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0, "w": 1},
}
pointcloud["frame_id"] = "lidar"
```

We'll leave the timestamp field for later, when we write the messages into the MCAP file.

### Create a writer

We'll start with some imports from the Python MCAP library:

```python
from mcap.mcap0.writer import Writer
from mcap.mcap0.well_known import SchemaEncoding, MessageEncoding
```

Open a file where we'll output our MCAP data and write our header:

```python
with open(args.output, "wb") as f:
  writer = Writer(f)
  writer.start()
```

### Register channel

Let's create a channel of messages to contain our point cloud. The schema's name and content tell Foxglove Studio that it can parse and display this message as a point cloud.

```python
with open(Path(__file__).parent / "PointCloud.json", "rb") as f:
  schema = f.read()
schema_id = writer.register_schema(
  name="foxglove.PointCloud",
  encoding=SchemaEncoding.JSONSchema,
  data=schema,
)
channel_id = writer.register_channel(
  topic="pointcloud",
  message_encoding=MessageEncoding.JSON,
  schema_id=schema_id,
)
```

### Write messages

Let's write a single `foxglove.PointCloud` message on the channel we just created:

```python
pointcloud["timestamp"] = {
    "sec": int(base_timestamp.timestamp()),
    "nsec": base_timestamp.microsecond * 1000,
}

writer.add_message(
    channel_id,
    log_time=int(base_timestamp.timestamp() * 1e9),
    data=json.dumps(pointcloud).encode("utf-8"),
    publish_time=int(base_timestamp.timestamp() * 1e9),
)
```

Close the MCAP writer to include the summary and footer in your output MCAP file:

```python
writer.finish()
```

That's it! We now have a valid MCAP file with a single point cloud message.

### Inspect your file

To inspect your MCAP file, install the [MCAP CLI tool](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/tree/main/go/cli/mcap#installing).

Run the following commands to summarize your file's contents and to verify that it has no issues:

```bash
$ mcap info output.mcap
  library: my-excellent-library
  profile:
  messages: 1
  duration: 0s
  start: 2011-11-04T01:36:05.987339008+11:00 (1320330965.987339008)
  end: 2011-11-04T01:36:05.987339008+11:00 (1320330965.987339008)
  compression:
    zstd: [1/1 chunks] (48.09%)
  channels:
    (1) pointcloud  1 msgs (+Inf Hz)   : foxglove.PointCloud [jsonschema]
  attachments: 0
$ mcap doctor output.mcap
  Examining output.mcap
```

### Visualize data

For a more visual representation of this data, let's use Foxglove Studio. Open either the [desktop](https://foxglove.dev/download) or [web app](https://studio.foxglove.dev), and add a [Raw Messages Panel](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/panels/raw-messages) and [3D Panel](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/panels/3d) to your layout.

Then, simply drag and drop your output MCAP file into the app window to start playing the data. Make sure to enable the `pointcloud` topic in the 3D (Beta) panel to display the point cloud in 3D space. You can also inspect the raw data for the `pointcloud` topic in your Raw Messages panel: ![pointcloud](./json-hero.png)
